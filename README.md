Add modal confirm dialogs in hindsite

## A working demo is located at  <a href='https://hgsweb.de/addConfirm/'> https://hgsweb.de/addConfirm/</a>  
  
  
### NOTE:  

While deploying confirmation dialogs should ideally be planned during the design 
and analysis phase of application development, sometimes legacy code presents
unique challenges.

In one such scenario, I encountered a clientâ€™s legacy system heavily interspersed
with user interactions that warranted confirmation prompts. Refactoring the 
codebase would have been time-consuming and risked further complicating 
the already tangled code structure.

To avoid introducing additional complexity and \"spaghettifying\" the code, I 
devised the following workaround to implement confirmation dialogs in a 
minimally invasive way. Though it may not be the most elegant long-term 
solution, it provides an efficient stopgap for managing user confirmations 
without a complete overhaul.

# Explanation:

### Problem:

In the given legacy code, instrument HTML elements having the `onclick` attribute   
referring to dangerous functions with confirm dialogs before performing the action.

### Example:

```html
<a class='doit need-confirm' href='changeSalary.html'>Do it!</a>
<button id='b1' class='need-confirm' onclick='deleteCustomer()'>Delete customer</button>
```
### Solution:

Add or extend the class list of the html elements in question with a dummy class need-confirm like :
```html
<a class='doit need-confirm' href='changeSalary.html'>Do it !</a>
<button id='b1' class='need-confirm' onclick='deleteCustomer()'>Delete customer </button>
```
Add:

```html
<script src='addConfirm.js'></script>
<script>addConfirm()</script>
```

## High level of how it works:  
  
Within ```addConfirm()``` all elements with a class need-confirm will be located and substituted by their clones.
Such a clone will capture the 'onclick' event and delegate it first to the confirm dialog of your choice.
If the confirmation is positiv/yes the 'onclick' event is fired again but this time the event is delegate to the original
node, that has the reference to the action to be executed.
